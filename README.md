# About

This is a rough and ready project that models an ATM. Done in a few hours so it is not completely implemented but does kind of show the basics of withdrawing money from an account from and ATM.

# Assumptions

1. No data access had been modeled or implemented
2. No transactions have been taken into consideration
3. Concurrency has not been taken into consideration because the would happen at transaction and account access level
4. Limited the number of dependencies as it is just a prototype - i.e. could have used things like Guava etc
5. Algorithms are working but not optimised as I don't know how they will be used
